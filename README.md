# Mini Bioinspired Smart Traffic Simulator

## Overview
This is a simplified version of a Smart Traffic Management System using:
- CRD (Colony-Based Route Discovery) for path planning
- CBO (Collective Behavior Optimization) for signal timing
- Simulated junctions and vehicles

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Unzip this folder.
3. Open a terminal or Command Prompt inside the folder.
4. Run:
```bash
python simulation.py
```
You should see vehicle flow output based on signal decisions.
