# Mini Bioinspired Smart Traffic Simulator

## Overview
This project is a simplified Smart Traffic Management System that simulates
traffic flow at junctions using bioinspired optimization techniques.

The system demonstrates:
- CRD (Colony-Based Route Discovery) for vehicle path planning
- CBO (Collective Behavior Optimization) for traffic signal timing
- Simulated junctions, vehicles, and signal decisions
- Visual and console-based traffic flow output

This project is intended for academic learning and project demonstration.
